LingQ To Memrise
================

A Google App Engine project to transfer LingQs from www.lingq.com to www.memrise.com to use the features from both.

It looks as though Memrise does not have an open API anymore sadly, so it seems that this probably won't be very useful but it does demonstrate how to access the LingQ API with python.
